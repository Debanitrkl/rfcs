# Title
Integrating awsssmchaosrunner with chaos-mesh, as part of enriching aws-chaos
## Summary

This will be a kotlin based CLI to run the awsssmchaosrunner, controller of awschaos will create a pod with that “kotlin cli image”, and send commands to inject chaos into EC2 instances

## Motivation
awsssmchaosrunner, released by asw opensource provides various functionalities to inject chaos in EC2 instance through SSM.
Integrating it with chaos-mesh would help us to add all the failure injections provided by awsssmchaosrunner in chaos-mesh.

## Detailed design
There would be two parts to it
1. The kotlin based CLI: awsssmchaosrunner being a kotlin library, we need to wrap it with a user-interface with functionalities of using SSM agent to inject the chaos. This user-interface would then be containerized as a docker image.
2. The controller part: The controller for the aws chaos like other chaos in chaos-mesh would be written in GOlang and in turn will create a pod with kotlin CLI image to send commands to inject the chaos.
